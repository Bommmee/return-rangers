        "answer": "In the appeal case of Millar v Commissioner of Taxation [2016] FCAFC 94, the two issues were: firstly, whether the primary judge was correct to hold that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal did not err in law in concluding that the appellants had not discharged their onus of proving that a loan arrangement they had entered into with a Samoan entity, Hua Wang Bank Berhad, was not a sham. The second issue was whether the primary judge was correct to hold that the taxpayers were required by s 12-245 of Sch 1 to the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (Cth) to pay withholding tax on the interest that was capitalised under the terms of that loan arrangement, and the failure to do so meant that the taxpayers were precluded by s 26-25 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth) from deducting the interest. The withholding tax issue only arises if the conclusions of the Tribunal and the primary judge were in error on the sham issue.",

The plaintiff did not accept that the hardship program it had instituted was relevant to the setting aside of the judgment. However, Mr Marks‑Isaacs relied upon that program as a factor influencing his conduct and I consider it as relevant on this application. However, there are two matters concerning this hardship program that do not assist Mr Marks‑Isaacs. 13. First, the hardship program might apparently still be available. The evidence discloses that after the judgment, the hardship program was nevertheless pursued by Mr Marks‑Isaacs (although he was, he says, unaware of the judgment) and considered by the plaintiff. It follows that the existence of the judgment does not, or at least did not, prevent that alternative form of ex gratia relief potentially being available to him. 14. Secondly, Mr Marks‑Isaacs does not appear to have reasonably pursued his hardship application. The application that he submitted was of a most cursory nature, referring only to two unattached letters dated two years previously and a \"more recent period of unemployment\". No details of the period of unemployment or of Mr Marks‑Isaacs’ income, expenses, assets and the like were provided, even though it was apparent, on the documents he provided to the Court, that the hardship program, at least in his case, depended on his financial position. When the plaintiff sought from Mr Marks-Isaacs his recent past tax returns to assess his financial position, those returns were not provided. In submissions to the Court Mr Marks‑Isaacs said that those returns remained unavailable as they had not yet been prepared. 15. In these circumstances, it is unsurprising that the hardship application was not successful. There was no evidence that Mr Marks-Isaacs has reapplied.

This issue was resolved by requiring Ms. Davison to pay the sum of $150,000 to Mr. Davison's trustee in bankruptcy. Additionally, Mr. Davison was alleged to have caused fees from his practice as a barrister to be paid into bank accounts of his wife, other family members, and the service company.

Mr. Davison also admitted to ground 4, which pertained to his indebtedness to the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation being greater than could have been discharged from his income as a barrister.",

The applicant has by reason of the unlawful termination of his employment lost more than six months’ remuneration and seeks compensation at a rate only equivalent to that contained in his group certificate.

The action of the respondent in both withholding any written reference and declining to supply an Employment Separation Certificate stating the reason for termination in my view is likely to have contributed to the applicant’s difficulties in obtaining employment. The applicant has by reason of the unlawful termination of his employment lost more than six months’ remuneration and seeks compensation at a rate only equivalent to that contained in his group certificate. The group certificate in evidence shows an average gross weekly income of $504 for the period between 1 July 1995 and 24 January 1996. This being so I propose to order pursuant to section 170DB of the Act the payment of two weeks’ wages in lieu of notice amounting to $1008.00 and, further order, the payment of twenty-four weeks’ compensation of $12,096.00. Both amounts should be paid less any tax payable and actually paid by the respondent before the expiration of the time for complying with the orders of the Court. MINUTES OF ORDERS THE COURT DECLARES THAT: 1. The termination of the applicant’s employment by the respondent on 24 January 1996 contravened Division III Part VIA of the Industrial Relations Act 1988. AND THE COURT ORDERS THAT within 21 days of the date of making these orders: 2. The respondent pay to the applicant: (a) damages pursuant to section 170EE(5) of the Industrial Relations Act 1988 in the sum of $1,008.00; and (b) compensation in the sum of $12,096.00"

        "answer": "In the case of R v James Nicholas Kontaxis [2016] NSWDC 199, the court considered several factors in assessing the objective seriousness of the offences. These included how the offences took place, over what period, with what degree of coercion, use of threats of pressure, and any immediate effect on the victim. The court also considered the degree to which the offender exploited the youth of the victim. Another relevant matter was the number of aggravating features present, with the general principle being that the more circumstances of aggravation are present, the more serious the offence. The Crown confirmed that the objective seriousness of the offending was, in the Crown’s submission, within the mid-range of offences pursuant to s 66C, if not above the mid-range.",

In the circumstances outlined earlier in these reasons, I am well satisfied that it is just and equitable to make the vesting order that Ms Hausler has sought. 20 That brings me to the conditions that I consider it is just and equitable to impose. 21 First, to address the difficulty posed by s 157 of the Land Title Act 1994 (Qld), I accept the undertaking of the applicant given by her lawyer that she will sign and execute a mortgage in the same terms as that appearing at exhibit RJH2 to the affidavit of Robyn Jane Hausler sworn 17 September 2019. 22 Secondly, and relatedly, I consider that it is just and equitable that the order vesting the property in Ms Hausler should be subject to the debt that was secured by the mortgage over the property which was executed by Ms Hausler on 27 August 2018 in favour of the Commonwealth Bank. 23 Thirdly and finally, I consider it is just and equitable to impose a condition on the vesting of the property that it be subject to any outstanding charges over the property that may have been imposed by statute or otherwise, including, but not limited to, any unpaid land tax, body corporate fees, local government rates and water and sewerage or similar charges. 24 Accordingly, the orders I will make are as follows: Upon the undertaking of the applicant to sign and execute a mortgage in the same terms as that appearing in exhibit RJH2 to the affidavit of Robyn Jane Hausler sworn 17 September 2019, I order that:"

No earlier financial statements were provided. There was no evidence as to what accounting records were maintained, such as ledgers or cashbooks, or what they reveal. 18The draft balance sheet as at 30 June 2011 did not include as a liability the debt then owed to the State Debt Recovery Office. Nor does the draft balance sheet record any debts to trade creditors. Ms Mateska's evidence is that the company carries on business as a landlord of both residential and commercial premises.

The court acknowledged the difficulties in determining this due to the competitive nature of the industry and the plaintiff's relative lack of establishment. However, the court was satisfied that due to his physical capacities, attractive looks and dedication to the industry, he would have achieved significant success. The court concluded that he would have likely earned at 70% of the average rate of the other stunt performers said to be comparable to him from the time of the accident until his illness. The plaintiff was therefore entitled to an amount calculated as 70% of the after-tax earnings of the other stunt performers from the date of the accident until April of the year the decision was made.",

After outlining details of the agreement, BHP stated: “… This Company will pay the interest due under Article 1.1 to GE on the closing date which is now anticipated to be 2nd April, 1984. The amount of the interest is to be calculated at the rate of 12% per annum but is limited to the combined net income of the Businesses and GE/UDC Businesses as defined. It is anticipated that the amount of interest payable will be of the order of US$190 million. The purpose for which the loan was raised was for the purchase on terms of the UI, UMC and UDC shares by an Australian entity (BHP) and is a qualifying use for purposes of Division 11A. BHP was an Australian entity at all times prior to and throughout the period of the loan. In this regard please refer to file WT 10 001 in relation to the Company’s status as an Australian entity. … It is requested that a Certificate of Exemption under Section 128H be issued to this Company in relation to the interest payable under the Purchase Agreement. The agreement was signed on 15th April, 1983 and is dated ‘as of 1st January, 1983’ and supersedes the Memorandum of Intention dated 27th January, 1983, between the parties. As the interest is due for payment on 2nd April, 1984, it is requested that an early reply be given to this letter. If there is any further information you require please contact Mr. F.A. Kenna on 609 3150.”"

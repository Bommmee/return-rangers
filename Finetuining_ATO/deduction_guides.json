The holding period rule mandates that you hold shares 'at risk' for at least 45 days (90 days for certain preference shares) without entering into any arrangements to reduce the risk of making a loss. The related payments rule applies if you had to make or were likely to make a related payment to another party for the dividend and did not hold your shares 'at risk' for at least 45 days. If you don't satisfy these rules, you cannot claim franking credits."

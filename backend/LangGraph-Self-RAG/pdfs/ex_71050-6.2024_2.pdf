Our commitment to you

Foreword

We are committed to providing you with reliable, accessible
and useful information to help you understand your rights and
entitlements and your obligations.

Individual tax return instructions 2024 is a guide that shows
you how to fill in your 2024 tax return correctly. For most
people, it covers all you need to fill in your tax return, but the
more technical and less commonly used information is available
at ato.gov.au/instructions2024

If you follow our information in this publication and it is either
misleading or turns out to be incorrect and you make a mistake
as a result, we must still apply the law correctly. If that means
you owe us money, you must pay it but we will not charge you
a penalty. Also, if you acted reasonably and in good faith we
will not charge you interest.
If correcting the mistake means we owe you money, we will
pay it and pay you any interest you are entitled to.
For more information, go to ato.gov.au/howyouareprotected
If you feel that this publication does not fully cover your
circumstances, or you are unsure how it applies to you,
you can seek further help from us.
Our Charter outlines the commitments we make to you and
everyone we work with, our expectations of you and steps
you can take if you are not satisfied. For more information,
go to ato.gov.au/ourcharter
We regularly revise our publications to take account of any
changes to the law, so make sure that you have the latest
information. If you are unsure, you can check for more recent
information at ato.gov.au or contact us.
This publication was current at June 2024.

What’s new this year?
New initiatives or legislation that may affect the individual
tax return or supplementary tax return 2024.

Effective life determination for depreciating assets

Cents per kilometre rate change

Use the effective life of a depreciating asset to work out
its decline in value. You can either make your own estimate
of its effective life or use the Commissioner’s effective life
determinations. For assistance with both, go to
ato.gov.au/effectivelife2024

From 1 July 2023, the cents per kilometre rate is 85c for
work‑related car expenses. If you’re using the cents per
kilometre method, use this rate in 2023 –24 income year.

Trust income schedule
From the 2024 income year, if you received one or more
distributions from trusts, you must complete Trust income
schedule 2024 and attach it to your tax return. The trust
income schedule details each distribution that you receive
from trusts.
Certain amounts reported in your trust income schedule are
reported in your supplementary tax return at questions:
• 13 Income
• 18 Capital gains
• 19 Foreign entities
• 20 Foreign source income and foreign assets or property.
For information to help you complete the trust income
schedule and who must complete the schedule, go to
ato.gov.au/trustincomeschedule2024
For more information, go to ato.gov.au/MTAS2024

We’re updating how we publish effective life determinations.

Self‑education deductions
From the 2024 income year, you claim all eligible deductions
for work‑related self‑education expenses at question D4
Work‑related self‑education expenses.
In prior income years you would claim formal education
courses provided by professional associations, seminars,
education workshops or conferences at question D5 Other
work‑related expenses.
This doesn’t change the types of expenses or deduction you
can claim, only the question where claim them.
This change is limited to expenses you claim at question D4
and D5.
You continue to claim motor vehicle and travel expenses at
questions D1 and D2.

Do you need to lodge a tax return?
If any of the following applies to you, then you must lodge
a tax return.

Reason 1
During 2023 –24, you were an Australian resident and
you either:
• paid tax under the pay as you go (PAYG) withholding
or instalment system
• had tax withheld from payments made to you
(excluding mining payments).

Reason 2
You were eligible for the seniors and pensioners tax offset
(see pages 35–7) and your rebate income (not including
your spouse’s) was more than:
• $32,279 if you were single, widowed or separated at any

ato.gov.au/incometestscalculator

Reason 3
You were not eligible for the seniors and pensioners tax offset
but you received a payment listed at question 5 Australian

payments which, when added together, made your taxable
income (from taxable income or loss in your tax return) more
than $21,884.

Employee share schemes
This question is about discounts on employee share scheme
interests (ESS interests) that you or your associate received
under an employee share scheme. ESS interests are:
• shares
• stapled securities (provided at least one of the stapled
interests is a share in a company)

Did any of the following apply to you?
• You received a discount on ESS interests acquired
under a ‘taxed‑upfront scheme’.
• A ‘deferred taxing point’ occurred in respect of your
ESS interests under a ‘deferral scheme’.
No	 Go to Income in your supplementary tax return.
Yes Read on.

• rights to acquire shares and stapled securities.
An ESS interest acquired by your associate in regard to
your employment is treated as though the ESS interest was
acquired by you.
The discount is the difference between the market value of
the ESS interests and the amount you paid to acquire them.
The ESS interests can:
• be from an Australian company or a foreign company
• relate to your employment inside or outside Australia
• relate to a work relationship other than employment –
for example, sub‑contracting.
Schemes where you are taxed on the discount in the year you
acquired the interest are known as ‘taxed‑upfront schemes’.
However, if you and the scheme meet certain conditions the
taxing point is deferred until a later time, this is known as the
‘deferred taxing point’. These tax‑deferred schemes are known
as ‘deferral schemes’.
Changes which apply to ESS interests acquired on or after
1 July 2015 include:
• changes to the timing of the ‘deferred taxing point’
• a tax concession through which some discounts on ESS
interests in start‑up companies will not be taxed under the
employee share scheme regime, as long as you meet the
eligibility criteria. Subsequent gains on the disposal of these
ESS interests will be taxed under the capital gains tax rules.

Answering this question
You will need your Employee share scheme statement from
each employer with whom you participated in an employee
share scheme.
An Employee share scheme statement can include comparable
statements from your employer and statutory declarations.
If you don’t have all your employee share scheme statements,
contact your employer.
For more information, go to ato.gov.au/essemployees, if:
• you were a temporary resident or foreign resident when you
received your ESS interests
• you disposed of your ESS interests because of a corporate
restructure or takeover and received replacement
ESS interests
• you received ESS interests from a foreign employer.
If your ESS interests are from a foreign employer, you might not
have an Employee share scheme statement. A foreign employer
can provide you the relevant details in writing.
You can use our ESS calculator to help you answer this
question. Go to ato.gov.au/esscalculator

Discounts on eligible ESS interests provided to you by a
start‑up company will not be included on your Employee share
scheme statement. Don’t show the discounts at this question.
From 1 July 2022, ceasing employment with the employer you
acquired the ESS interests from is no longer a deferred taxing
point. If you cease employment on or after 1 July 2022, the
deferred taxing point will become the earliest of the remaining
deferred taxing points. This change applies to ESS interests
under deferral schemes, regardless of when they are acquired.
For more information on ESSs, go to ato.gov.au/keychangesess

Completing your tax return

If the amount that you calculated was greater than
$180,000, you are not entitled to a reduction. Add up the
amounts that you wrote at labels D, E, and F. Write the
total at label B.

If an associate of yours, for example your spouse, acquired an
ESS interest as a result of your employment, you must include
their discount in your assessable income. Your associate does
not include the discount in their tax return.

If the amount that you calculated was less than or equal to
$180,000, you are eligible for the reduction of up to $1,000.
If the amount at label D is:
• Less than or equal to $1,000, add up the amounts that
you wrote at labels E, and F and write the total at label B.
• More than $1,000, add up the amounts at labels D, E,
and F then subtract $1,000 away from the total. Write the

If you wrote an amount at label D, you may be entitled
to reduce the amount of the discounts received under
‘taxed‑upfront schemes’ by up to $1,000.
To work out whether you are entitled to this reduction,
calculate your taxable income without including any
discount reduction and excluding any assessable First
home super saver released amount. If you had a taxable
loss, treat it as zero for the purposes of this calculation.

You may be entitled to claim a foreign income tax offset for
discounts if you have paid foreign income tax in respect of
the discounts.
Write at label A the total amount of your discounts from
ESS interests for which you are claiming a foreign income
tax offset.
To claim a foreign income tax offset, you must complete
the supplementary tax return question 20 – label O in your
tax return. For information on how to calculate a foreign
income tax offset, read Guide to foreign income tax offset
rules 2024.

Claiming deductions
You may be able to claim deductions for work‑related
expenses you incurred while performing your job as
an employee. You incurred an expense in 2023 –24 if:
• you received a bill or invoice for an expense that you were
liable for (even if you paid it after 30 June 2024), or
• you did not receive a bill or invoice but you were charged
and you paid for the expense in 2023 –24.
If your expense includes an amount of goods and services tax
(GST), the GST is part of the total expense and is therefore
part of any deduction. For example, if you incurred union
fees of $440 which included $40 GST, you claim a deduction
for $440.

Basic rules
To claim a deduction for work‑related expenses:
• you must have spent the money yourself and not
been reimbursed
• the expense must be directly related to earning your income
• you must have a record to prove the expense.
The expense must not be private, domestic or capital in nature.
For example, the costs of normal travel to and from work, and
buying lunch each day are private expenses.
If you incurred an expense that was both work‑related and
private or domestic in nature, you can claim a deduction only
for the work‑related portion of the expense.
If you were partially reimbursed for an expense, you can claim
only the part that was not reimbursed.

Allowances
If you received an allowance that you showed at question 2 in
your tax return, you may be able to claim a deduction for your
expenses covered by the allowance. The expenses must be
incurred in producing your employment income, and must meet
the basic rules discussed above. For example, if you received
a tools allowance of $500 and your tool expenses were $300,
you include the whole amount of the allowance at question 2 in
your tax return and claim a deduction of $300 at question D5.

Individual tax return instructions 2024

Decline in value of a depreciating asset
You may be able to claim a deduction for the decline in value
of a depreciating asset you held during 2023 –24 if you used it
to produce income that you show in your tax return.
Depreciating assets include items such as tools, reference
books, computers and office furniture.
You may be able to claim an immediate deduction for the full
cost of depreciating assets costing $300 or less. For more
information, see Guide to depreciating assets 2024 (NAT 1996).
Go to ato.gov.au/depreciatingassets2024 to get
a copy of this publication.

Advance expenditure
If you have prepaid an amount for a service costing $1,000
or more, and the service extends for a period of more than
12 months or beyond 30 June 2025 (such as a subscription
to a journal relating to your profession), you can claim only
the portion that relates to 2023 –24. You can also claim
the proportion of your pre‑paid expenses from a previous
year that relate to 2023 –24. For more information, see
Deductions for prepaid expenses 2024.
Go to ato.gov.au/prepaidexpenses2024 to get
a copy of this publication.

Record keeping for work‑related expenses
You must be able to substantiate your claims for deductions
with written evidence if the total amount of deductions you
are claiming is greater than $300. The records you keep
must prove the total amount, not just the amount over $300.
The $300 does not include car and meal allowance, award
transport payments allowance and travel allowance expenses.
There are special written evidence rules for these claims which
are explained at the relevant questions.
If the total amount you are claiming is $300 or less, you need
to be able to show how you worked out your claims, but you
don’t need written evidence.

No	 Go to question D2.
Yes Read on.

Answering this question
What can you claim?
You can claim car expenses you incurred in performing your
employment duties in 2023 –24.
You can also claim the cost of using your car to travel directly
between 2 separate places of employment when you have a
second job, providing one of the places is not your home.

The most you can claim using the cents per kilometre method
is 5,000 work‑related kilometres per car, even if you travelled
more. No written evidence of expenses is necessary with this
method, but you need to be able to show how you worked
out your work‑related kilometres (for example, by producing
diary records of work‑related trips).

for all cars).

• your home is a base for employment (you were required to
start work at home and travelled to a workplace to continue
work for the same employer), or

(c)  Divide (b) by 100.

• you have shifting places of employment (you regularly work
at more than one place each day).

Work‑related travel expenses

Did you have any work‑related travel expenses?
No	 Go to question D3.
Yes Read on.

This question is about travel expenses you incur in performing
your work as an employee. They include:
• public transport, air travel and taxi fares
• bridge and road tolls, parking fees and short‑term car hire
• meal, accommodation and incidental expenses you incur
while away overnight for work
• expenses for motorcycles and vehicles with a carrying
capacity of one tonne or more, or 9 or more passengers,
such as utility trucks and panel vans
• actual expenses, such as petrol, repair and maintenance
costs, that you incur to travel in a car that is owned or leased
by someone else.
If your employer provided a car for you or your relatives’
exclusive use and you were entitled to use it for non‑work
purposes, you cannot claim a deduction for running costs,
such as petrol, repairs and other maintenance. This includes
a car provided under a salary sacrifice agreement. However,
you can claim expenses such as parking, bridge and road
tolls for work‑related use. Parking at, or travelling to, a regular
workplace is not ordinarily considered to be a work‑related
use of the car.

Reasonable allowance amounts
If your travel allowance was not shown on your income
statement or payment summary and was equal to or less than
the reasonable allowance amount for your circumstances, you
don’t have to include the allowance at question 2 provided
that you have fully spent it on deductible work‑related travel
expenses and you don’t claim a deduction for these expenses.
You must go to ato.gov.au/taxreturninstructions2024
and read question D2 if any of the following apply:
• you had shifting places of employment
• your allowance was above the reasonable
allowance amounts.

Individual tax return instructions 2024

Answering this question
You must have written evidence for the whole of your claim.
To claim meal, accommodation and incidental expenses,
you must have incurred the expenses when you travelled
and stayed away from your home overnight in the course of
performing your work duties. You must also have paid the
expenses yourself and not have been reimbursed.
You cannot claim meal, accommodation and incidental
expenses, if the expenses were incurred because:
• you lived a long way from where you worked because of
your personal circumstances
• there was a change to your regular place of work and you
lived away from your usual residence to be closer to your
new regular place of work (living away from home)
• you chose to sleep at or near your workplace rather than
returning to your home between shifts.
Use the table on page 73 to determine what evidence you
need to claim accommodation, meal and incidental expenses.

for clothing that is:
• protective clothing and footwear, such as fire‑resistant
clothing, sun protection clothing, safety‑coloured vests,
non‑slip nurse’s shoes, steel‑capped boots, gloves, overalls,
aprons, and heavy‑duty shirts and trousers (but not jeans)
that you wear while working to either
– protect you from the risk of illness or injury

Answering this question
In all circumstances, you need to keep evidence such as diary
records that show how you calculated your claim.
Where you claim a deduction for:
• buying, dry‑cleaning, or repairing work‑related clothing and
footwear and your total work‑related expenses claim is more
than $300, you need to keep written evidence (such as
receipts or invoices)
• buying, dry‑cleaning, or repairing work‑related clothing and
footwear and your total work‑related expenses claim is $300
or less, you can claim the amount you spent without written
evidence
• laundry expenses (excluding dry‑cleaning expenses) and
– your total laundry claim is $150 or less, you can claim
a deduction without written evidence

– prevent damage to your ordinary clothes, caused by
your work or work environment. You can claim the cost
of protective equipment, such as hard hats and safety
glasses at question D5.
• a non‑compulsory uniform that your employer has
registered on the Register of Approved Occupational
Clothing (check with your employer if you are not sure)
• a compulsory uniform that is a set of clothing or a single
item that is distinctive (such as one that has your employer’s
logo permanently attached to it) and identifies you as
an employee of an organisation. There must be a strictly
enforced policy making it compulsory to wear that clothing at
work. Items may include shoes, stockings, socks and jumpers
where they are an essential part of a distinctive compulsory
uniform and the colour, style and type are specified in your
employer’s policy.

– your total laundry claim is more than $150, you must
have written evidence (such as receipts or invoices)
If your total claim for work‑related expenses is more than $300,
you must have written evidence for all of your work‑related
expenses. However, you can claim for laundry expenses
up to $150 without written evidence. This doesn’t increase
the $300 work‑related expenses limit to $450 – go to,

use a reasonable basis to calculate the amount, that is:
• $1 per load for work‑related clothing
• 50c per load if you mix personal items of clothing with work
clothing from one of the categories above.

• occupation‑specific clothing which allows people to
easily recognise that occupation (such as the chequered
pants a chef wears when working) and which are not for
everyday use.

• You must claim at this question any deductible work‑related
clothing, laundry and dry‑cleaning expenses incurred
in earning income shown on an income statement or a

Seniors and pensioners
(includes self‑funded retirees)
You can claim the seniors and pensioners tax offset if you met
all the conditions relating to:
• eligibility for Australian Government pensions or allowances,
and
• income.

Completing your tax return

1

Transfer the amount you have shown at SUBTOTAL on
page 4 of your tax return to TAXABLE INCOME OR LOSS.

Keep a record of this amount to work out your tax losses of
earlier income years for next year.

If you had a spouse:
• you also need to work out whether they were eligible
• you may not get the seniors and pensioners tax offset even
if you meet all the eligibility conditions as the amount of the
tax offset is based on your individual rebate income, not your
combined rebate income.

You have now completed this section. Go to question T1.

them to create a tax loss. Any losses you have remaining
can be carried over to future years until they have been
fully recouped.

A Medicare levy reduction is based on your taxable income.
A Medicare levy exemption is based on specific categories.
You need to consider your eligibility for a reduction or an
exemption separately.

If you have a spouse, you may not get the seniors and
pensioners tax offset even if you meet all the eligibility
conditions as the amount of the tax offset is based on your
individual rebate income, not your combined rebate income.
If you don’t get the offset, merely being eligible for it will not

spouse, see Definitions on page 72.

Part A – Medicare levy reduction

If you were single and you had no dependent children during
2023 –24, go to Part B – Medicare levy exemption.

Answering this question

A dependent child is any child:

Your eligibility for a Medicare levy reduction is based on your
taxable income, your spouse’s taxable income and the number
of dependent children you have.
Your taxable income must be equal to or less than the relevant
upper threshold in table 1 for you to qualify for a reduction. If
your taxable income is equal to or less than the relevant lower
threshold, you don’t pay the Medicare levy.
We will work out any reduction for you.

• who was an Australian resident whom you maintained
in 2023 –24, and
• whose adjusted taxable income (ATI) was less than the
relevant ATI amount.
For the meaning of dependent child, see Definitions on
page 70.

Reductions based on family income
Family taxable income is:
• the combined taxable incomes of you and your spouse
(including a spouse who died during 2023 –24), or
• your taxable income if you were a sole parent with
a dependent child or dependent children.
Your family taxable income must be equal to or less than
the limits in table 2 for you to qualify for a reduction:

Medicare levy. Depending on your income for MLS purposes,
the MLS rate is 1%, 1.25% or 1.5% of:
• your taxable income
• your total reportable fringe benefits, and
• any amount on which family trust distribution tax has
been paid.
You may have to pay the MLS if:
• you or your dependants (including your spouse, even if they
had their own income) did not have an ‘appropriate level of
private patient hospital cover’ for the whole of 2023 –24, and
• your income for MLS purposes was above a certain amount.
If you are not sure whether you had an ‘appropriate level
of private patient hospital cover’ during 2023 –24, contact
your health insurer. You can also ask your health insurer for a
statement showing the number of days that you and all your
dependants had an appropriate level of health cover. For the
meaning of appropriate level of private patient hospital cover,
see Definitions on page 69.

For this question, your dependants (regardless of their income)
are your:

• children under 21 years old
• children 21 to 24 years old who are studying full time
at school, college or university.
Your dependants must have been Australian residents for
tax purposes in 2023 –24 and you must have contributed to
their maintenance. For the meaning of Australian resident for
tax purposes and maintaining a dependant, see Definitions
on pages 69 and 70.

The example below explains how to:
• work out your WHM net income
• complete this question.

Working holiday makers and visa class changes
If you remained in Australia on a temporary COVID‑19
pandemic event 408 visa as a result of your 417 or 462 visa
expiring, you will be taxed as if you remained on a 417 or 462
working holiday visa. Complete this question as though you
remained on a 417 or 462 working holiday visa.

Answering this question
Your working holiday maker net income is the Australian
sourced income you earned while you were on a 417 or 462
working holiday visa, less deductions relating to earning
that income.
For more information about working holiday makers (WHMs),
go to ato.gov.au/whm

Working out your WHM net income

1

Add up your WHM income, that is salary and wages, that:
• you showed at question 1 in your tax return, and
• you earned while you were on a 417 or 462 visa.
In most cases, income statements and payment
summaries from your employer will show the payment
type H to indicate that you earned WHM income.

Example: WHM net income and completing your tax return
Kiara, a citizen of Canada, is on a working holiday in Australia,
on a 417 visa.
Between September 2023 and June 2024 Kiara worked on
a number of farms in NSW and earned a total of $47,000.
Her deductions relating to this income are $800.
Kiara will show $46,200 at question A4 – label D ($47,000
income from the farms less $800 deductions relating to earning
that income).
Kiara will write Canada at question A4 – label E.
Kiara also includes her deductions in the deductions section
of their tax return.

show the payment type H but you earned income while
you were on a 417 or 462 visa, then include that income
in this step.
You must also show the payment type H against this
income at question 1.

Definitions
Some of the following definitions apply to all questions, while
some only apply to specific questions. Each definition identifies
which question it applies to.

Adjusted taxable income (all questions)
Adjusted taxable income (ATI) is an amount that is used most
commonly to determine eligibility for certain tax offsets.
The following amounts are used to calculate a person’s ATI:
• taxable income (excluding any assessable First home
super saver released amount)
• reportable employer superannuation contributions
• deductible personal superannuation contributions
• adjusted fringe benefits total, which is the sum of

To work out a person’s ATI, go to ato.gov.au/
incometestscalculator or use the ATI worksheet on the next
page. If you are using the calculator and you are working
out the dependant’s ATI for part of the year or the ATI of a
deceased person, you need to read the instructions below.
If you are working out the ATI of a person for the whole year,
you can get the amounts for the ATI worksheet from the
person’s tax return.
If you are working out a dependant’s ATI for part of the year,
you cannot use the figures from their tax return. Instead,
you must work out the amounts for the period they were a
dependant and complete the worksheet using these figures.
The instructions at each question will tell you what to do.

– reportable fringe benefits amounts received from
employers exempt from fringe benefits tax under
section 57A of the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment
Act 1986 multiplied by 0.53, and

If you are completing a tax return for a deceased person, or
your spouse died during the year and you need to know their
ATI for the whole of 2023 –24, their ATI is the amount worked
out with the calculator or at row (k):

– reportable fringe benefits amounts from employers not
exempt from fringe benefits tax under section 57A of the
Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986

• multiplied by 366.

• divided by the number of days the person was alive in
2023 –24, and

• certain tax‑free government pensions or benefits received
by the person
• target foreign income
• net financial investment loss
• net rental property loss
less
• child support payments the person provided to
another person.

Appropriate level of private patient hospital cover
(question M2)
An appropriate level of private patient hospital cover is cover
provided by a registered health insurer for hospital treatment
in Australia which has an excess of:
• $750 or less (for a policy covering only one person), or
• $1,500 or less (for all other policies).
Excess is the amount you pay before your health insurer pays
for any claim you make.
General cover (formerly called ancillary cover) or ‘extras’ is not
private patient hospital cover because it covers only items such
as optical, dental, physiotherapy or chiropractic treatment.

Australian resident for tax purposes (all questions)
Generally, we consider you to be an Australian resident for
tax purposes if you:
• have always lived in Australia or you have come to Australia
and live here permanently
• have been in Australia continuously for 6 months or more,
and for most of that time you worked in the one job and lived
at the same place
• have been in Australia for more than 6 months during
2023 –24, unless your usual home is overseas and you don’t
intend to live in Australia

Combined rebate income (question T1)
The combined rebate income of you and your spouse is
the total of:
• your rebate income
• your spouse’s rebate income, and
• the amount on which the trustee of a trust was liable to
pay tax in respect of your spouse because your spouse
was under a legal disability, such as being an undischarged
bankrupt or a person who was declared legally incapable
because of a mental condition.

Dependants (question M1 for Medicare
levy exemption)
For question M1, dependant means an Australian resident
you maintained who was:
• your spouse
• your child under 21 years old, or
• your child, 21 to 24 years old, who was receiving full‑time
education at a school, college or university and whose
adjusted taxable income (ATI, see pages 67–8) for the period
you maintained the child was less than the total of $282 plus
$28.92 for each week you maintained them.
See Maintaining a dependant on page 70.

If you need help in deciding if you are an Australian resident for
tax purposes, go to ato.gov.au/residency

If the parents of a child lived apart for all or part of the income
year and the child was a dependant of each of them, the child
is treated as an equal dependant of each parent. However,
where a parent receives Family tax benefit (FTB) Part A for the
child, including receiving only the rental assistance component,
the child is a dependant of that parent for the number of days
the child was in their care.

Child (all questions)

Dependants (question M2)

• go overseas temporarily and you don’t set up a permanent
home in another country, or
• are an overseas student who has come to Australia to study
and are enrolled in a course that is more than 6 months long.

Child includes:
• your adopted child, stepchild or ex‑nuptial child
• your child born or adopted in 2023 –24
• a child of your spouse, and
• someone who is your child within the meaning of the Family
Law Act 1975 (for example, a child who is considered to be a
child of a person under a state or territory court order giving
effect to a surrogacy agreement).

Individual tax return instructions 2024

For question M2, your dependants (regardless of their income)
are your:
• spouse, even if they worked during 2023 –24 or had their
own income
• children under 21 years old
• children who are 21 to 24 years old who are studying
full‑time at a school, college or university.
Your dependants must have been Australian residents in
2023 –24 and you must have contributed to their maintenance.

69

Dependent child (question M1 for Medicare
levy reduction)
A dependent child is any child who was an Australian
resident whom you maintained in 2023 –24 and whose
adjusted taxable income (ATI, see pages 67–8) was less than:

Family agreement (question M1)
A family agreement is a written agreement signed by you and
your spouse. You complete a family agreement only if both you
and your spouse would have to pay the Medicare levy were it
not for your exemption category status. You don’t need to send
this agreement to us. Keep it with your records. The agreement
must contain:
• the statement: “We agree that the Medicare levy exemption
in respect of our dependants for 2023 –24 will be claimed
as follows.”
• name of person claiming the full exemption
• name of person claiming the half exemption
• your signature
• your spouse’s signature.

Income statement
If your employer is reporting through Single Touch Payroll, your
income statement replaces your payment summary.
You can access your income statement online in myGov.
We update your income statement throughout the year when
your employer pays you. If your income statement is:
• tax ready, your employer has finished with your income
statement and you can use it to do your tax return
• year to date or not tax ready, your employer has not finished
with your income statement. Your employer must finalise
your information by 14 August.

Incur or incurred (all questions)
You incur an expense in an income year when you:
• receive a bill or invoice for an expense that you are liable
for and must pay (even if you don’t pay it until after the end
of the income year), or
• don’t receive a bill or invoice but you are charged and
you pay for the expense.

Maintaining a dependant (questions M1, M2 and IT8)
You maintained a dependant if any of the following applied:
• you both lived in the same house
• you gave them food, clothing and lodging
• you helped them to pay for their living, medical and
educational costs.
If you had a spouse for the whole of 2023 –24 and your spouse
worked at any time during the year, we still consider you to
have maintained your spouse as a dependant for the whole
income year.
We consider you to have maintained a dependant even if
the 2 of you were temporarily separated, for example, due to
holidays or overseas travel.
If you maintained a dependant for only part of the year,
you may need to adjust your claim accordingly.

The agreement must be signed before the date the person
claiming the full exemption lodges their tax return unless the
Commissioner allows further time.

Shared care (question M1 and T4)
You had shared care if you, and your spouse if you had one,
cared for your child for some of the income year, and someone
else, such as a former spouse, cared for the child for the rest
of the income year.
If you received family tax benefit (FTB) Part B as part of a
shared‑care arrangement, you will need to know your FTB
shared‑care percentage to calculate your spouse offset. Your
FTB shared‑care percentage is usually not the same as your
‘shared care percentage’ which appears on correspondence
you have received from Services Australia.
If you don’t know your FTB shared‑care percentage, contact
Services Australia (see page 80 for contact details).

Spouse (all questions)
Your spouse includes another person who, for 2023 –24:
• you were in a relationship with that was registered under
a prescribed state or territory law
• although not legally married to you, lived with you on
a genuine domestic basis in a relationship as a couple.

Tax‑free government pensions or benefits that
are taken into account in the income tests
(question IT3)

• Partner service pension where either
– the partner and the veteran are under the age‑pension
age and the veteran is receiving an invalidity service
pension, or

a choice under section 236 of that Act) or of a lump sum
mentioned in subsection 236(5) of that Act.
If you are not sure, for the purpose of this question, whether a
government pension or benefit you have received is tax‑free,
phone 13 28 61.

If you receive any of the government pensions or benefits
listed below, you must include at question IT3 the part of those
pensions and benefits that are exempt from tax. In some cases,
all of your pension or benefit could be exempt from tax, and in
other cases only part of it might be.
Don’t include any part of these pensions and benefits that
is a bereavement payment, pharmaceutical allowance, rent
assistance or remote area allowance, or language, literacy

Tax‑free income for temporary residents
If you are a temporary resident your foreign income is
non‑assessable non‑exempt income, except for income
you earn from your employment overseas while you are a
temporary resident, which may be taxable.
You are a temporary resident if:
• you hold a temporary visa granted under the Migration
Act 1958
• you are not an Australian resident within the meaning
of the Social Security Act 1991, and

Other amounts that you don’t pay tax on
You don’t pay tax on:
• most child support and spouse maintenance payments
• allowances you received as a volunteer in the Australian
government funded Australian Volunteers Program
• government super contributions.
There are other amounts that are generally not taxed, such as
lottery winnings and inheritances.
For more information, go to ato.gov.au/amountsnotincome

• your spouse (if you have one) is not an Australian resident
within the meaning of the Social Security Act 1991.
If on 6 April 2006, or at any time since, you were an Australian
resident for tax purposes but not a temporary resident, you are
not entitled to the temporary resident exemptions from that
time, even if you later held a temporary visa.
